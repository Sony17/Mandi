*Mandi House*

Mandi in Hindi language means market place. Such market places were for food and agri-commodities. This will be platform for the farmers to sell their comodities and also a place to own and sell there agri data and platform where farmers can raise funds for the next season .

My original idea was to create a marketplace for Agriculture ecosystem for exchange services and goods which essentially facilitates.

Exchange of digital and physical goods .
Let the peers in Network to secure /own unique Digital data as NFT . The data can be research / idea + solution + resource(digital+physical+knowledge)/ innovation/patent /educational courses /whitepaper /digital asset
Crowd fund for there agriculture project
In this hackathon I was only able to only accomplish Pointer 2. To accomplish that ,minting text data as NFT was required .One can upload its text data in doc/ pdf /txt flle and timestamp it under their name.

Having text data as NFT as well could help us Securing and owing any data we want to own. For example It will help.. 1.Writers to mint their book as NFT and sell. 2.Entrepreneurs /developers to mint their ideas and problem solving along with the resources(digital asset and networks) they have, as NFT . They as monetise and crowdfund 3.One can mint ones social media handle username to recognise fake and duplicate accounts. 4.Your resume as NFT etcâ€¦etc..etc..

One can timestamp any data and own it if we can tokenise that data as NFT .

This product had turned out to be a platform where one can mint text data as NFT.
